# Game of Thrones Data Visualisation: "The Timeline of Ice and Fire"

*A narrative of character changes across episodes in Game of Thrones TV series*

### Originally done as part of a uni course project by:

* Dan Kennedy

> Game of Thrones is an epic series, with a vast cast and sprawling plotline. This visualisation encapsulates the entire saga: the rise and fall of characters, families and houses, the pivotal quotes and the gruesome means of death. 
Drawing from an API of Ice and Fire (anapioficeandfire.com), as well as publicly available IMDb data and web pages, the application creates new connections between detailed character data and information on the TV series.

This is more than I give you in a year.</p><p>Bronn: He's a squire. You don't pay him.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Oh. Then it's much more than I give you in a year.</p><p>Podrick Payne: They wouldn't take it, milord.</p><p>Bronn: [confused] Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They're happy enough to take it when I give it to them.</p><p>Bronn: [looks at Podrick] What did you tell them?</p><p>Podrick Payne: I didn't tell them anything.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: What did you do to them?</p><p>Podrick Payne: Lots of things.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: And they seemed to like these things?</p><p>Podrick Payne: Yes, milord.</p><p>Bronn: Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Only they weren't paid.</p><p>Bronn: What're you saying?

That's what's wrong with it. The Crown owes millions to my father.</p><p>Bronn: Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Forgive a debt? My father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.</p><p>Bronn: I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed-upon period of time, you return it with interest.</p><p>Bronn: And what if I don't?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Well, you have to.</p><p>Bronn: But what if I don't?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about, it's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the Bank will fund our enemies.

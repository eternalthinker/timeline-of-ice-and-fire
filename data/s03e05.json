You are supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.</p><p>[Brienne jumps on her feet furiously, looking at Jaime offended.

Let's call a truce.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: You need trust to have a truce.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I trust you.</p><p>[Brienne sits back, looking at Jaime loathingly]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: Of course.</p><p>[Jaime tells Brienne what has happened in that fateful day he killed Aerys. Brienne listens intently]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city. Beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey sunken cunt. \"You can trust the Lannisters,\" he said \"The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown\". So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. \"Burn them all,\" he said \"Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds\". Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?</p><p>[Brienne does not answer. Jaime continues his story]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then, when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. \"Burn them all,\" he kept saying \"Burn them all\". I don't think he expected to die. He... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [bitterly] Stark? You think the *honorable* Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion?</p><p>[Jaime starts to stand]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [furiously] By what right?</p><p>[Jaime, too weak to stand on his feet, stumbles and falls into the water. Brienne manages to catch him before he drowns]</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: [shouts] Guards! The Kingslayer!</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [whispers painfully] Jaime... my name is Jaime.</p>"

You are supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.</p><p>[Brienne jumps on her feet furiously, looking at Jaime offended.

Let's call a truce.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: You need trust to have a truce.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I trust you.</p><p>[Brienne sits back, looking at Jaime loathingly]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: Of course.</p><p>[Jaime tells Brienne what has happened in that fateful day he killed Aerys. Brienne listens intently]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city. Beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey sunken cunt. \"You can trust the Lannisters,\" he said \"The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown\". So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. \"Burn them all,\" he said \"Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds\". Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?</p><p>[Brienne does not answer. Jaime continues his story]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then, when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. \"Burn them all,\" he kept saying \"Burn them all\". I don't think he expected to die. He... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [bitterly] Stark? You think the *honorable* Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion?</p><p>[Jaime starts to stand]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [furiously] By what right?</p><p>[Jaime, too weak to stand on his feet, stumbles and falls into the water. Brienne manages to catch him before he drowns]</p><p>Brienne of Tarth: [shouts] Guards! The Kingslayer!</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [whispers painfully] Jaime... my name is Jaime.</p>",
      "<p>[Jaime and Brienne are brought before Roose Bolton]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Lord Bolton... is there word from the capital?</p><p>Roose Bolton: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing, sailed into Blackwater Bay, stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister...</p><p>[Roose pauses intentionally, wearing a sad expression.

I'm told you had a hand in planning it.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Naturally.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.

I'd nearly forgotten.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Yes, and maintaining supply lines...</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: [cutting him off] I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Eighteen hundred mounted lances. Two thousand in support. Provisions, so this city might survive the winter.

You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses, I'm quite familiar with them.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: And we are so grateful for your contributions, which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.

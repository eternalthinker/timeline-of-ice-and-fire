      "<p>Bronn: Our lord here used to be married.</p><p>Shae: Married?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [annoyed] How did you hear that?</p><p>Bronn: You hear lot of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [stands] Another night, perhaps.</p><p>Shae: [grabs his hand] Not another night. This night!</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: It's not a pleasant story.</p><p>Shae: Or maybe I will cry.</p><p>Bronn: I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [sits down] So... I was sixteen. My brother Jaime and I were riding when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough while I wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so Jaime hunted down the rapers, I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan, and she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. I forgot how frail I was around girls. I was always waiting for them to laugh at me, or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall handsome brother. I forgot about everything but Tysha, and somehow I found myself in her bed...</p><p>Bronn: For three chickens, I should hope so!</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Didn't last long: I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards, and sang me a song, and by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, and one drunken septon, and there you have it: man and wife. A fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father...</p><p>Bronn: Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Not quite. First my father had Jaime tell me the truth: the girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing: the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well, a silver for each of them. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver, that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor.</p><p>Bronn: I would have killed the man who did that to me.</p><p>Shae: You should have known she was a whore.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Really? I was sixteen, drunk and in love.</p><p>Shae: A girl who is almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: As I said, I was young and stupid.</p><p>Shae: You are still young and stupid.</p><p>[Shae approaches Tyrion and lies on top of him. They start having sex. Bronn realizes that he is not needed, and leaves]</p>",
      "<p>Bronn: Stay low.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Stay low?</p><p>Bronn: If you're lucky, no one will notice you.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I was born lucky.</p>"

      "<p>[after killing Shae, Tyrion takes a crossbow, then heads down the hall to the privy, opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet. Tywin seems surprised to see Tyrion, but quickly regains his composure]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Tyrion. Put down the crossbow.</p><p>[Tyrion does not comply]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Who released you? Your brother, I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers.</p><p>[Tywin starts to stand, but Tyrion steadies the crossbow, stopping Tywin]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: This is how you want to speak to me, hmm? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: All my life you've wanted me dead.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that. Even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you. Is that what you fear? I'll never let Ilyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son.</p><p>[Tyrion does not believe his father]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I loved her.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Who?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Shae.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Oh, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I murdered her. With my own hands.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: It doesn't matter.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Doesn't matter?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: She was a whore.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [raises the crossbow] Say that word again...</p><p>Tywin Lannister: And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Now, enough of this nonsense.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I am your son and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I can't go back there. She's in there.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: You're afraid of a dead whore?</p><p>[Tyrion shoots Tywin in the belly, knocking him backwards. Tywin groans in pain. Tyrion reloads the crossbow]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: You shot me.</p><p>[Tywin becomes angry]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Ohh... you're no son of mine.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I am your son. I have always been your son.</p><p>[Tyrion shoots again, killing his father. Tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves. The door opens, Varys stands there. He is shocked to see Tywin dead]</p><p>Lord Varys: What have you done?</p><p>[Tyrion does not answer]</p><p>Lord Varys: Quickly.</p><p>[Varys pulls Tyrion away, bolting the door behind them. He leads Tyrion to a room where is a large crate]</p><p>Lord Varys: Trust me, my friend. I brought you this far.</p><p>[Varys helps Tyrion to enter the crate, then shuts it. Moments later, the crate is stowed aboard a ship. Varys begins walking back towards the Red Keep, but stops when he hears the bells tolling, signaling that Tywin's body has been discovered. Realizing that returning to the castle is unsafe, Varys turns around and heads back for the ship, sitting next to Tyrion's crate in silence as the ship sails for Essos]</p>",
      "<p>Cersei Lannister: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle of Blackwater...</p><p>[Tywin is walking away]</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [voice raised] Do you remember?</p><p>[Tywin stops and turns to Cersei]</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade. That's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: No.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy. My last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in and you'll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: And how will you do that?</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I'll tell everyone the truth.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: What truth would that be?</p><p>Cersei Lannister: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying? Of course it's possible. How can some so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you, and you didn't see us. One look in the past 20 years, one real look at your own children and you would have known.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Known what?</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Everything they say is true, about Jaime and me.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: No.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Your legacy is a lie.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: I don't believe you.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [smirking] Yes, you do.</p>"

Then he approaches his opponent]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Have they told you who I am?</p><p>Gregor Clegane: [snarls] Some dead man!</p><p>Oberyn Martell: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking, shit-pile of a city? For you. I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can end this quick.</p><p>[the duel continues. Oberyn manages to knock off Gregor's helmet]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children. You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!</p><p>[Oberyn circles around his opponent, forcing him to tire himself out, dodging his charges, parries his swings and stabs back, while taunting him repeatedly to confess about killing Elia and her children. Gregor manages to knock Oberyn several times off his feet and cuts his spear into half. Oberyn evades Gregor's blows with amazing agility, and grabs a replacement spear from his squire. Cersei starts to look increasingly put-out, while Jaime and Tyrion look surprised and relieved by Oberyn's skill; Tywin looks vaguely amused. Again, Gregor knocks Oberyn off his feet, but Oberyn evades his blows and stabs him in the chest. Gregor stumbles away, but quickly recovers and continues his attack]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: You raped her! You murdered her!</p><p>[Gregor charges. Oberyn evades his blow and cuts his hamstring. Gregor groans in pain and kneels down]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: You killed her children!</p><p>[Oberyn charges, burying his spear in Gregor's stomach, pinning him to the floor and causing him to cough blood. Cersei looks angry and frustrated, while Ellaria, Jaime and Tyrion smile in relief, thinking that the duel is over. But Oberyn does mean to let Gregor die without confessing. He circles Gregor furiously]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Wait, are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.</p><p>[Oberyn extracts his spear from Gregor's body]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell.</p><p>[Oberyn points accusingly at Tywin]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Who gave you the order? WHO GAVE YOU THE ORDER? Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children! Say it! Say her name!</p><p>[Tyrion is slightly worried, anxiously waiting for Oberyn to finish off Gregor. Oberyn and Ellaria smile at each other]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Say it!</p><p>[Oberyn gets too close to Gregor. Gregor trips him over. Oberyn starts to get up, but Gregor grabs his throat and punches him in the mouth, breaking his teeth. Ellaria and Tyrion gasp. Oberyn slumps down stunned, his mouth bleeding. Gregor is on top of Oberyn, grabbing his head with his massive hands, plunging his large thumbs into his eyes, gouging them. Oberyn screams in agony]</p><p>Gregor Clegane: [roars] Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head in like this!</p><p>[Gregor then crushes Oberyn's skull between his huge fists with a sickening thump. Ellaria screams in horror. Gregor, severely injured, collapses next to his dead opponent. A stunned silence sweeps over the crowd. Cersei smirks triumphantly. Tyrion closes his eyes, unable to believe that his champion is killed so close to victory. Tywin stands]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of his Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.</p><p>[Jaime looks at his brother sadly. Tyrion cannot even reply, shockingly stares in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn's skull-crushed body]</p>"

      "<p>Tyrion Lannister: What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Beheading.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [referring to Alton Lannister] Cousins.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Of course. Wet nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.</p><p>[Jaime and Tyrion jokingly mimic how Orson used to crush beetles and the \"kun kun kun\" he made while doing so]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Nothing made him happier.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Nothing made YOU happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: The joke wore thin, though.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: For you. You drifted away.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I had other interests.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Why?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\". He gave me an answer \"Smath the beetles. Smath 'em. kun kun kun\".</p><p>[Jaime chuckles]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [shakes his head disgustedly] Volarik. Tried to touch me once.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him, the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand, but he wasn't mindless, he had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began spending inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"kun kun kun\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No, I heard \"kun kun kun\". And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know because it was horrible, that all these beetles would be dying for no reason.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Every day around the world, men, women and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: He was twice your size.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: He just pushed me aside with a \"kun\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.</p><p>[Tyrion notices a beetle on the floor. He picks it up, puts it back down and leaves it unharmed]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I don't know.</p><p>[they hear bells tolling. Jaime stands and starts walking out of the cell]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Good luck today.</p><p>[Jaime leaves]</p>"

      "<p>Tyrion Lannister: What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Beheading.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [referring to Alton Lannister] Cousins.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Of course. Wet nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.</p><p>[Jaime and Tyrion jokingly mimic how Orson used to crush beetles and the \"kun kun kun\" he made while doing so]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Nothing made him happier.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Nothing made YOU happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: The joke wore thin, though.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: For you. You drifted away.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I had other interests.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Why?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\". He gave me an answer \"Smath the beetles. Smath 'em. kun kun kun\".</p><p>[Jaime chuckles]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [shakes his head disgustedly] Volarik. Tried to touch me once.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him, the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand, but he wasn't mindless, he had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began spending inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"kun kun kun\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No, I heard \"kun kun kun\". And I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know because it was horrible, that all these beetles would be dying for no reason.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Every day around the world, men, women and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: He was twice your size.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: He just pushed me aside with a \"kun\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.</p><p>[Tyrion notices a beetle on the floor. He picks it up, puts it back down and leaves it unharmed]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I don't know.</p><p>[they hear bells tolling. Jaime stands and starts walking out of the cell]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: Good luck today.</p><p>[Jaime leaves]</p>"

Gregor manages to knock Oberyn several times off his feet and cuts his spear into half. Oberyn evades Gregor's blows with amazing agility, and grabs a replacement spear from his squire. Cersei starts to look increasingly put-out, while Jaime and Tyrion look surprised and relieved by Oberyn's skill; Tywin looks vaguely amused. Again, Gregor knocks Oberyn off his feet, but Oberyn evades his blows and stabs him in the chest. Gregor stumbles away, but quickly recovers and continues his attack]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: You raped her! You murdered her!</p><p>[Gregor charges. Oberyn evades his blow and cuts his hamstring.

Cersei looks angry and frustrated, while Ellaria, Jaime and Tyrion smile in relief, thinking that the duel is over. But Oberyn does mean to let Gregor die without confessing. He circles Gregor furiously]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Wait, are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed.</p><p>[Oberyn extracts his spear from Gregor's body]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children.

Say it! Say her name!</p><p>[Tyrion is slightly worried, anxiously waiting for Oberyn to finish off Gregor. Oberyn and Ellaria smile at each other]</p><p>Oberyn Martell: Say it!</p><p>[Oberyn gets too close to Gregor. Gregor trips him over. Oberyn starts to get up, but Gregor grabs his throat and punches him in the mouth, breaking his teeth. Ellaria and Tyrion gasp. Oberyn slumps down stunned, his mouth bleeding. Gregor is on top of Oberyn, grabbing his head with his massive hands, plunging his large thumbs into his eyes, gouging them. Oberyn screams in agony]</p><p>Gregor Clegane: [roars] Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head in like this!</p><p>[Gregor then crushes Oberyn's skull between his huge fists with a sickening thump. Ellaria screams in horror.

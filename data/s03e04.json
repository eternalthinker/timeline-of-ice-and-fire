Sam does not take part in the fighting, but instead rushes outside to find Gilly. Mormont nearly manages to choke Rast to death, but then the wound he sustained takes its toll. Blood pours from Mormont's mouth. He lets go of Rast and sinks to the ground. Rast recovers, grabs a knife and stabs Mormont repeatedly in the chest until he is dead.

      "<p>Lord Varys: I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Which is Sansa Stark?</p><p>Lord Varys: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Yes, Ned Stark had many admirers. And how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?</p><p>Lord Varys: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: How?</p><p>Lord Varys: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.</p><p>Lord Varys: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.</p><p>Lord Varys: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: And why have you come to me with this matter?</p><p>Lord Varys: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?</p><p>[Olenna smiles]</p><p>Lord Varys: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.</p><p>Lord Varys: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: [chuckling] You must despise him, you're working so hard to undermine him.</p><p>Lord Varys: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: You are a clever man, Lord Varys.</p><p>Lord Varys: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?</p>",
      "<p>[Olenna is watching some of her young granddaughters sewing]</p><p>Young Tyrell Lady: Do you like it, Nana?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Another golden rose, how original. I eat from plates stamped with roses, I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses, I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot... as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear.</p><p>[Olenna leans forward to look at the stitching]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: \"Growing Strong.\" Ha! The dullest words of any House. \"Winter Is Coming.\" Now that's memorable. \"We Do Not Sow.\" Strong, strong, those are Houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts... but a golden rose growing strong? Ha! That strikes fear in the heart.</p><p>[Olenna looks up and sees Varys walking towards them]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along, now. Grow strong.</p><p>[the young ladies bow and leave]</p><p>Lord Varys: My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?</p><p>Lord Varys: A little obvious, perhaps.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Oh, no, please! Seduce away, it's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?</p><p>[Varys looks down at his crotch, then back at Olenna, at a loss for words]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?</p><p>Lord Varys: Might I sit?</p><p>[Varys starts toward a nearby chair]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: No.</p><p>[Varys stops and looks at Olenna]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you sought me out.</p><p>Lord Varys: You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden, and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.</p><p>Lord Varys: Is she?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.</p><p>Lord Varys: She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.</p><p>[Varys turns to leave]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: [chuckling] Come, come. You surrender rather easily.</p><p>[Olenna gets up and takes Varys's arm]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.</p>"

And some of us tanners, and masons. That was before.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: No. Fighting in war makes you a soldier.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: And I won't see them again.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [looking around again] Stark deserters, Baratheon deserters... you lot aren't fighting in a war, you're running from it!</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are, a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Untie these ropes and we'll find out.</p>",
      "<p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: What are you doing, leading a mob of peasants?</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother, in King Robert's name.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.</p><p>[the Hound spits]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: You're fighting for ghosts.</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: That's what we are: ghosts. Waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear - Lannister, Stark, Baratheon - you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: You found god, is that it?</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god, as have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.</p><p>Thoros of Myr: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder. Only justice.</p><p>Anguy: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions, you call yourselves? At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door!</p><p>Thoros of Myr: House Clegane was built upon dead children! I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?</p><p>Anguy: MURDER is a crime!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: I never touched the Targaryen babes! I never saw them! Never smelled them, never heard them bawling! You want to cut my throat? Get on with it! But don't call me \"murderer,\" and pretend that you're not.</p><p>Arya Stark: You murdered Mycah! The butcher's boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed, and you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Aye, he was a bleeder.</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: You don't deny killing this boy?</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.</p><p>Arya Stark: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Then I should've killed YOU! Not my place to question princes.</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: So, who will it be?</p><p>[the Hound leans in close to Thoros]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?</p><p>[the Hound turns to Anguy]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand?</p><p>[the Hound nods at Arya]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Or is the little girl the bravest one here?</p><p>Beric Dondarrion: Aye, she might be... but it's me you'll fight.</p>"

      "<p>Lord Varys: I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Which is Sansa Stark?</p><p>Lord Varys: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Yes, Ned Stark had many admirers. And how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?</p><p>Lord Varys: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: How?</p><p>Lord Varys: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.</p><p>Lord Varys: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.</p><p>Lord Varys: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: And why have you come to me with this matter?</p><p>Lord Varys: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?</p><p>[Olenna smiles]</p><p>Lord Varys: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.</p><p>Lord Varys: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: [chuckling] You must despise him, you're working so hard to undermine him.</p><p>Lord Varys: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: You are a clever man, Lord Varys.</p><p>Lord Varys: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: One doesn't need to be clever for that. It's all rather obvious, isn't it?</p>",
      "<p>[Olenna is watching some of her young granddaughters sewing]</p><p>Young Tyrell Lady: Do you like it, Nana?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Another golden rose, how original. I eat from plates stamped with roses, I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses, I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot... as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear.</p><p>[Olenna leans forward to look at the stitching]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: \"Growing Strong.\" Ha! The dullest words of any House. \"Winter Is Coming.\" Now that's memorable. \"We Do Not Sow.\" Strong, strong, those are Houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts... but a golden rose growing strong? Ha! That strikes fear in the heart.</p><p>[Olenna looks up and sees Varys walking towards them]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along, now. Grow strong.</p><p>[the young ladies bow and leave]</p><p>Lord Varys: My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?</p><p>Lord Varys: A little obvious, perhaps.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Oh, no, please! Seduce away, it's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?</p><p>[Varys looks down at his crotch, then back at Olenna, at a loss for words]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?</p><p>Lord Varys: Might I sit?</p><p>[Varys starts toward a nearby chair]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: No.</p><p>[Varys stops and looks at Olenna]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you sought me out.</p><p>Lord Varys: You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden, and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.</p><p>Lord Varys: Is she?</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood.</p><p>Lord Varys: She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.</p><p>[Varys turns to leave]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: [chuckling] Come, come. You surrender rather easily.</p><p>[Olenna gets up and takes Varys's arm]</p><p>Lady Olenna Tyrell: Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.</p>"

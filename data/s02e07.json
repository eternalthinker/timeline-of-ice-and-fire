      "<p>Tywin Lannister: This'll be my last war... win or lose.</p><p>Arya Stark: Have you ever lost before?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: You think I'd be in my position if I'd lost a war?</p><p>[Arya shakes her head]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: And this is the one I'll be remembered for. \"The War of Five Kings,\" they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months. You know what \"legacy\" means?</p><p>[Arya shakes her head again]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: It's what you pass down to your children, and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. Greatest fortress ever built. Tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five, can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?</p><p>Arya Stark: Dragons?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Yes. Dragons happened. Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could've marched on these walls and a million men would've been repelled. But an attack from the air, with dragonfire... Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name, three hundred years after his death.</p><p>Arya Stark: Aegon and his sisters.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Hm?</p><p>Arya Stark: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Correct. A student of history, eh?</p><p>Arya Stark: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhaghar.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.</p><p>Arya Stark: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called \"Dark Sister.\"</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Hm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it. Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil, with flowers in her hair?</p><p>Arya Stark: Most girls are idiots.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: [laughs] You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?</p><p>Arya Stark: From my father.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: [gives Arya a searching look] He was a well-read stonemason? Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.</p><p>Arya Stark: Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: [with a small smile] Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful.</p>",
      "<p>Tywin Lannister: Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.</p><p>[Arya takes a plate with mutton and turns to leave]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Girl...</p><p>[Arya freezes in fear, unsure what Tywin intends]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: M'lord.</p><p>[Arya turns to Tywin, stares at him confused]</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Lowborn girls say \"m'lord\", not \"my lord\". If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.</p><p>Arya Stark: [defiantly] My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, MY LORD. She taught me how to speak proper... properly.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: [amused] You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?</p><p>Arya Stark: [smiles] Yes.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Go on.</p><p>[relieved, Arya leaves]</p>"

It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. Greatest fortress ever built. Tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five, can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?</p><p>Arya Stark: Dragons?</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Yes. Dragons happened. Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could've marched on these walls and a million men would've been repelled. But an attack from the air, with dragonfire... Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

Visenya rode Vhaghar.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.</p><p>Arya Stark: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called \"Dark Sister.\"</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Hm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it. Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?

We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes; that's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.</p><p>Gregor Clegane: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Have you gone soft, Clegane?

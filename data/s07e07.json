Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words; she wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: You killed our father.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me!</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [sarcastically] Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have ANY idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart.

If it weren't for me, you'd have a father. If it weren't for me, you'd have two beautiful children.

And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world, not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.

      "<p>[Tyrion is escorted by Ser Gregor Clegane to Cersei]</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [referring to Daenerys] I shouldn't be surprised. I suppose she's your kind of woman. A foreign whore who doesn't know her place.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [hatefully] So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I didn't know about that...</p><p>Cersei Lannister: And now you've got both working towards the same goal, the goal you've been working towards your entire life...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Cersei, I didn't know.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: ...the destruction of this family.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words; she wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: You killed our father.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me!</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [sarcastically] Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have ANY idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella. You killed Tommen. No one would have touched them if Father was here, no one would have dared!</p><p>Cersei Lannister: [steps forward] I have never been more sorry about anything...</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I will not hear it, not from you. I will NOT hear it!</p><p>[pause]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat, so put an end to me.</p><p>[Cersei looks at the Mountain, obviously tempted]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [angrily, goading her] If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother. If it weren't for me, you'd have a father. If it weren't for me, you'd have two beautiful children. I've thought about killing you more times than I can count!</p><p>[Tyrion turns to face the Mountain, then turns back to face Cersei]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [shouts] DO IT! Say the word!</p><p>[the Mountain partly draws his sword. For a tense moment, Tyrion and Cersei glare silently at one another, before Cersei sighs and slumps back in her chair. Tyrion sighs with relief. The Mountain sheathes his sword. Tyrion pours some wine into a cup and drinks. Then he refills the cup and offers it to Cersei. He takes another cup and faces Cersei]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: [quietly] I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I will not...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I don't care! I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart, if there's anything left of it.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter, your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did, I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: If there's no future, then why did you allow me to come?</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Yes, no. Not what you hoped for, but you must've hoped for something.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your Queen?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Mmm, not like this.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Yes.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Why?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Because I think she will make the world a better place.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them. That's the difference between you.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I don't care about checking my worst impulses, I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.</p><p>[Cersei puts a hand on her stomach]</p><p>Cersei Lannister: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world, not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: You're pregnant.</p>",
      "<p>Tyrion Lannister: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: We all know that will never happen.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Then why are we here?</p><p>Jon Snow: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living.</p>"

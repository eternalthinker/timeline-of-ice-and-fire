How tolerant of you.</p><p>Oberyn Martell: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Please give him my regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he'll be able to walk again.</p><p>Oberyn Martell: They call it a rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.</p><p>Tywin Lannister: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.</p><p>Oberyn Martell: People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in a latter sort of place.</p>"

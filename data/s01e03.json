You were only a squire, 16 years old.</p><p>Jaime Lannister: [to Selmy] You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw. A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.</p><p>Robert Baratheon: Your outlaw... any last words?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so... no.</p><p>Barristan Selmy: Hmm.</p><p>Robert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?</p><p>Jaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... \"Burn them all\".</p><p>[Robert gapes at Jaime]</p><p>Jaime Lannister: If that's all, Your Grace...</p><p>[Jaime bows to Robert and Selmy, then leaves the room]</p>",

How did you do it?</p><p>Barristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.</p><p>Robert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, the dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait\".</p><p>[Robert chuckles to himself]</p><p>Robert Baratheon: They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarly's bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys, and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.</p>"

That's something to think about when you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels. Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall.

I don't believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the Wall.

The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher, maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track 'em and I know how to kill 'em.

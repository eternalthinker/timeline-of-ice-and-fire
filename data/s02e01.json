Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.</p><p>Ser Davos Seaworth: Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother...</p><p>Stannis Baratheon: I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king.</p><p>Ser Davos Seaworth: But many have already declared for him. Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly...</p><p>Melisandre: Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support, the Lord of Light stands behind him.</p><p>Ser Davos Seaworth: And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?</p><p>Melisandre: He has no need for ships.</p><p>Ser Davos Seaworth: I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.</p><p>Stannis Baratheon: Who'd steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.</p>"

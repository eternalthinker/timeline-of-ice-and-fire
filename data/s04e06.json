He is a bastard, born of incest, as was his brother before him.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: Yes, we have heard this story.</p><p>Stannis Baratheon: It's not a story. It's the truth.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: The king's grandfather tells a different story.

We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less... open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?</p><p>Stannis Baratheon: Four thousand.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: And how many ships do you have?</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Uh...</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.</p><p>[Davos clears his throat uncomfortably]</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Thirty-two.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your four thousand men on your thirty-two ships?</p><p>Stannis Baratheon: None.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: You can see why these numbers are unlikely to add up to a happy ending... from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: [tries desperately to salvage the situation] My lord...</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either, here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving, that would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.</p><p>[Davos removes the glove from his left hand, revealing his shortened fingers]</p><p>Davos Seaworth: This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man, and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros, which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: The war is over.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: As long as Stannis lives, the war is NOT over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: Ser Davos...</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Now, humor me.</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: Tywin Lannister.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: How old is Tywin Lannister?</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: Sixty-seven.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Sixty-seven, and when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, the queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, the man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?</p><p>Tycho Nestoris: That is a problem for another time.</p><p>Davos Seaworth: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros: Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander, and he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.</p><p>[Davos holds up his mutilated hand again]</p>"

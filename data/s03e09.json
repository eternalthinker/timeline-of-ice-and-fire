The old man's no threat.</p><p>Orell: [to Tormund] I keep telling you.</p><p>Ygritte: He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.</p><p>Jon Snow: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do.</p>",
      "<p>[the wildlings capture an old man outside the tower where Bran and his group are hiding. The old man sits up and pulls out a knife as Tormund walks up to him]</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: That won't help you, grandpa.</p><p>[Tormund holds out his hand; the old man hands Tormund the knife, and he tosses it away]</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: Where you riding?</p><p>Old Man: Doesn't matter now, does it?</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: No. It doesn't matter now.</p><p>Orell: Cut his throat, or he'll tell the Crows we're here.</p><p>[Tormund unsheathes his sword]</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: You understand.</p><p>Old Man: Let me stand, at least. Let me go with a bit of dignity.</p><p>[Tormund helps the old man to his feet]</p><p>Orell: [to Tormund] Make the crow kill him.</p><p>[Orell walks up to Jon]</p><p>Orell: You're one of us now. Prove it.</p><p>[inside the tower, Jojen tries to convince Bran to warg into Summer]</p><p>Jojen Reed: The wolves are out there.</p><p>Bran Stark: I can't do it by choice. I don't know how, it's... it happens in my dreams.</p><p>Jojen Reed: You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.</p><p>Bran Stark: I can't.</p><p>Jojen Reed: You just did, with him.</p><p>[Jojen gestures at Hodor]</p><p>Jojen Reed: A wolf is nothing compared to that.</p><p>[outside, Jon unsheathes his sword and lays it against the old man's neck]</p><p>Old Man: She looks sharp.</p><p>[Jon nods. The old man closes his eyes and begins to pray. Jon hesitates]</p><p>Ygritte: Do it. Do it!</p><p>Orell: I told you. He's still one of them.</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: Go on, boy! Go on!</p><p>[Jon steels himself, swings his sword back, but can't bring himself to execute the old man. Ygritte quickly nocks an arrow to her bow and shoots the old man in the heart. The wildlings all draw their weapons as Jon goes into a defensive stance and Ygritte nocks another arrow]</p><p>Orell: He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.</p><p>[tense pause]</p><p>Tormund Giantsbane: Kill him!</p>"

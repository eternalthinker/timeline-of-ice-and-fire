You're my family. The men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.</p><p>[everyone cheers]</p><p>Walder Frey: Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her baby. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter everyone of the Starks.</p><p>[everyone start groaning]</p><p>Walder Frey: No, no. That was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out root and stem.</p><p>[everyone starts gagging and coughing]</p><p>Walder Frey: Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.</p><p>[everyone starts dying from poison.

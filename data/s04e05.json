That's no way to fight.</p><p>Arya Stark: It's not fighting, it's water dancing.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [laughs] \"Dancing\"? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?</p><p>Arya Stark: The greatest swordsman who ever lived: Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [scoffs] Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, was he? They all are.</p><p>Arya Stark: [angrily] What do you know about anything?</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: I bet his hair's greasier than Joffrey's cunt.</p><p>Arya Stark: It was not!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: \"Was\"? He dead?</p><p>Arya Stark: Yes!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: How?</p><p>Arya Stark: He was killed!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Who by?</p><p>Arya Stark: Meryn Trant! That's why Ser Meryn's on my...</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [incredulously] Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived, killed by Meryn fucking Trant?</p><p>Arya Stark: He was outnumbered!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.</p><p>Arya Stark: Syrio didn't HAVE a sword! OR armor, just a stick!</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [sarcastically] The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword?</p><p>[the Hound laughs]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: All right, you have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.</p><p>[Arya lunges at the Hound's chest with her sword, but it lodges in his armor. He backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground, then picks up her sword and points it at her throat]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Your friend's dead, and Meryn Trant's not, 'cause Trant had armor. And a big fucking sword.</p><p>[the Hound raises Arya's sword, looks at it for a moment, then hands it back to her]</p>",
      "<p>[at night, Arya recites the names of the people she wants dead]</p><p>Arya Stark: Joffrey... Cersei... Walder Frey... Meryn Trant... Tywin Lannister... the Red Woman... Beric Dondarrion... Thoros of Myr... Ilyn Payne... the Mountain.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [irritated] Would you shut up?</p><p>Arya Stark: I can't sleep until I say the names.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: The names of every fucking person in Westeros?</p><p>Arya Stark: Only the ones I'm going to kill.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: [sneers] Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most.</p><p>[slight pause]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.</p><p>Arya Stark: If he were here right now, what would you do?</p><p>[the Hound glances at Arya for a long moment before answering]</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.</p><p>Arya Stark: I'm almost done. Only one name left.</p><p>Sandor 'The Hound' Clegane: Go on.</p><p>Arya Stark: The Hound.</p><p>[the Hound looks at Arya, saying nothing]</p>"

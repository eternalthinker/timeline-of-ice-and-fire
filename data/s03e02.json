I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother, a woman he didn't even know! So I prayed to all Seven Gods \"Let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us\".</p><p>Talisa Maegyr: And he lived?</p><p>Catelyn Stark: And he lived.

His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now...

Father liked him, and so did Loras.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does NOT make him wise. As for your fathead father...</p><p>Margaery Tyrell: Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate.</p><p>[Olenna looks at Sansa]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this, if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udder, so here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa?</p><p>[Sansa does not know what to say]</p>",
      "<p>Olenna Tyrell: Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?</p><p>Sansa Stark: I haven't had the pleasure.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: [chuckles] No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now... I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.</p><p>Sansa Stark: I... I...</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?</p><p>[Sansa remains silent]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Has he ripped out your tongue?</p><p>Sansa Stark: [stammering] Joff - KING Joffrey, he, His Grace, is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion...</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?</p><p>Margaery Tyrell: I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.</p><p>[a server appears with a platter of lemon cakes and sets it in front of Olenna]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Bring me some cheese.</p><p>Server: The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: The cheese will be served when I want it served, and I want it served now.</p><p>[the server bows and leaves]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: [to Sansa, offering her a lemon cake] Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.</p><p>Sansa Stark: My father always told the truth.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him \"traitor\" and took his head.</p><p>Sansa Stark: [suddenly and spitefully] Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off, and he said THAT was mercy. And he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.</p><p>[pause]</p><p>Margaery Tyrell: Go on.</p><p>Sansa Stark: [quickly becoming afraid] I - I - I can't, I never meant... my father was a traitor, my brother as well, I have traitor's blood... please don't make me say any more.</p><p>Margaery Tyrell: She's terrified, Grandmother, just look at her.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.</p><p>[Sansa pauses, then looks fearfully at Olenna]</p><p>Sansa Stark: He's a monster.</p><p>[neither Olenna nor Margaery react]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Oh. That's a pity.</p><p>Sansa Stark: Please don't stop the wedding.</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: [chuckles] Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery should be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth.</p><p>[Olenna looks up and sees the server approaching]</p><p>Olenna Tyrell: Ah! Here comes my cheese.</p>"

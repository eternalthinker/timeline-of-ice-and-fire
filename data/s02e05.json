      "<p>Protestor: Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings. Are we surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes. A rotten king.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: It's hard to argue with his assessment.</p><p>Bronn: Not after what he did to your birthday present.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.</p>",
      "<p>Tyrion Lannister: Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: She'll be safer in Dorne.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Yes, I know how \"concerned\" you are for her safety.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl, and I don't blame her at all for you.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: So clever. Aren't you? Always so clever with your schemes and your plots.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Schemes and plots are the same thing.</p>",
      "<p>[Lancel is in Tyrion's palanquin to discuss Cersei's plans]</p><p>Lancel Lannister: It's wildfire.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?</p><p>Lancel Lannister: No.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: That's a lie right there.</p><p>Lancel Lannister: It is NOT a lie. Why would I lie?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Tell me: if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you, or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.</p><p>Lancel Lannister: I'm telling you the truth...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: The smart money would be on \"more likely\".</p><p>Lancel Lannister: She's making wildfire, I sw...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: But then, perhaps his own unnatural urges would give him sympathy for yours.</p><p>Lancel Lannister: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: I suppose there's only one way to find out.</p><p>Lancel Lannister: They have thousands of pots, already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls in Stannis' ships and armies. Please!</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: When did she tell you this?</p><p>Lancel Lannister: I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Swear to me on what?</p><p>Lancel Lannister: On my life!</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: But I don't care about your life.</p><p>Lancel Lannister: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: All right, all right, enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.</p><p>[Tyrion kicks Lancel out of the palanquin]</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.</p><p>[Bronn, who is waiting outside, looks at Lancel expectantly]</p><p>Lancel Lannister: Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.</p><p>[Lancel runs away]</p><p>Bronn: It will be my pleasure.</p>",
      "<p>Tyrion Lannister: I remember reading an old sailor's proverb. Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.</p><p>Hallyne: Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true.</p>",
      "<p>[Tyrion and Cersei are discussing Renly's mysterious death]</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Killed? By whom?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Really? Who'd have thought?</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Whomever did it, I say well done.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: That's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.</p><p>Cersei Lannister: Littlefinger says we can outspend him three-to-one.</p><p>Tyrion Lannister: And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money.</p>"
